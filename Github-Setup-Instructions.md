# GitHub Setup Instructions

We've created a ZIP file of your portfolio project that you can now manually upload to your GitHub repository. Due to GitHub token permission limitations, direct push access was restricted.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Portfolio ZIP File**
   - Look for `portfolio.zip` in your Replit Files panel (in the root directory)
   - Click to download it to your local machine

2. **Extract the ZIP File** on your local machine

3. **Upload to GitHub**
   - Go to [https://github.com/mouli3029/r-portfolio](https://github.com/mouli3029/r-portfolio)
   - Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop all the extracted content
   - Add a commit message like "Initial portfolio upload"
   - Click "Commit changes"

4. **Alternative: Clone and Push via Terminal**
   If you're comfortable with Git commands, after extracting:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial portfolio upload"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/mouli3029/r-portfolio.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   
   This approach will require you to authenticate with your GitHub username and personal access token.

## Portfolio Structure Overview

The main components of your portfolio are organized as follows:

│   ├── src/                    
│   │   ├── components/          # UI components (Header, Footer, Hero, etc.)
│   │   ├── contexts/            # React context providers
