IMPORTANT PATH INFORMATION FOR GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT

When setting up your GitHub Actions workflow for GitHub Pages deployment, make sure you specify the correct build output path:

path: "./dist/public"

This is critical because the Vite build process in this project outputs files to the "dist/public" directory, not just "dist" as in a standard Vite project.
